## Hi there 👋 I'm Josh

I'm a developer and VFX worker who loves building tools, systems, and worlds.  
Half of what I make is for work, the other half is just for fun, and often times those halves overlap.

💻 **What I do**
- 🧰 Build creative and technical tools in **Python** for automation, pipelines, and workflow improvements  
- 🎮 Develop games in Godot (GDScript) — currently working on [Spellbrawl](https://github.com/SirNoods/spellbrawl), a chaotic wizard fighting game  
- 🎶 Music production, sometimes experimental, sometimes not as much

🧠 **Stuff I enjoy**
- VFX & animation, pipelines and render management  
- Writing & Worldbuilding  
- Making small, useful things that make life easier for others (or just for me and my linux setup)
- Music! All the music!

🧑‍🔧 **Current Projects**
- [**Spellbrawl**](https://github.com/SirNoods/spellbrawl) — a whimsical 2D magic brawler built in Godot  
- [**govee-cli**](https://github.com/SirNoods/govee-cli) — control your Govee lights from the terminal  
- [**strudels**](https://github.com/SirNoods/strudels) — a collection of experiments with [strudel.cc](https://strudel.cc/), a live-coding environment for music

🪄 **Tech I work with**
`Python` · `GDScript` · `Godot` · `Blender` · `Nuke` · `Maya` · `Tractor 2` · `FL Studio` · `Linux` · `Git`  
and a lot of random scripts that make pipelines or games run smoother.

- Polishing my scripts and tools for showcase
- Trying to write more devlogs
